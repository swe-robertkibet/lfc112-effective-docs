# LFC112 Course Notes: Creating Effective Documentation for Developers

This repo contains my personal notes and takeaways from **Creating Effective Documentation for Developers (LFC112)** by The Linux Foundation. I found myself constantly referring back to concepts from this course, so I wrote these article-style summaries to help cement what I learned and share it with others who might find it useful.

The course is designed for developers, technical writers, and project maintainers who want to create better documentation for APIs and open source projects. Judy Bogart, the instructor, brings years of experience in technical writing and API documentation, and her practical approach really clicked with me. If you're struggling with documenting your code or working with technical writers, this course covers a lot of ground you'll find helpful.
