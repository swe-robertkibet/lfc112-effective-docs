# LFC112 Course Notes: Creating Effective Documentation for Developers

This repo contains my personal notes and takeaways from **Creating Effective Documentation for Developers (LFC112)** by The Linux Foundation. I found myself constantly referring back to concepts from this course, so I wrote these article-style summaries to help cement what I learned and share it with others who might find it useful.

The course is designed for developers, technical writers, and project maintainers who want to create better documentation for APIs and open source projects. Judy Bogart, the instructor, brings years of experience in technical writing and API documentation, and her practical approach really clicked with me. If you're struggling with documenting your code or working with technical writers, this course covers a lot of ground you'll find helpful.

I want to thank [Judy Bogart](https://www.linkedin.com/in/judy-bogart-977ba0/) for putting together such a thoughtful course. Her insights into the collaboration between developers and technical writers really opened my eyes to how much better documentation can be when done right. The way she breaks down complex topics made everything feel approachable, even for someone like me who isn't a professional writer.

## Getting Started

If you're new here, I'd suggest starting with the articles in order - they build on each other naturally. Each one focuses on practical takeaways you can apply right away to your own documentation projects.

## Articles

- `01-course-intro.md` - Course overview and what to expect from learning about developer documentation
- `02-ideal-api-reference.md` - Key principles for creating API reference documentation that developers actually want to use
- `03-doc-tools.md` - Documentation generation tools and how to improve what they produce
- `04-working-with-writers.md` - How developers and technical writers can collaborate effectively on documentation projects
