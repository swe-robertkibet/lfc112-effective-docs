# Working with Documentation Professionals

This was probably the most eye-opening section of the course for me. As a developer, I'd always assumed that writing documentation was just part of the job - something you do alongside coding. Judy made a compelling case for why that approach often doesn't work well, and how collaboration with professional writers can make everyone more effective.

## Why Developers Struggle with Documentation

The course starts with an honest assessment: asking developers to document their own code has a real impact on development productivity. Writing code and writing natural language are different skills, and even developers with good communication abilities usually aren't familiar with the planning and organizational challenges of technical documentation.

More importantly, writing tasks are often at odds with coding responsibilities in terms of both task allocation and mindset. When you're deep in implementation details, it's hard to step back and think about what a new user needs to know.

The result is usually more efficient and higher quality when you assign documentation planning and production to technical communication professionals, with developers contributing technical information and reviewing drafts.

## Skills That Make Documentation Effective

Judy introduces two specific skill sets that technical writers develop:

**Knowledge engineering** - the ability to extract information from subject-matter experts and analyze it with the goal of communicating it clearly to others. This includes recognizing different types of knowledge (factual vs. procedural) and knowing how to elicit the right information.

**Information architecture** - organizing and presenting knowledge so it's accessible to different types of users. This means understanding when someone needs a reference table versus a tutorial, or how to structure information for different learning styles.

While some developers have excellent writing skills, this isn't their primary expertise, and they're usually fully occupied with building the software. The course argues it's more constructive to have professional writers and editors work with the development team.

## Making It Work in Open Source

For open source projects, Judy recommends actively recruiting community members with writing and editing skills. Writers need to know their contributions are valued, and engineers need to know these resources are available.

The key is framing documentation as a collaborative activity that benefits both sides. Writers improve their product knowledge by focusing on specific areas, and developers learn about the user perspective, which can actually improve their design choices.

## Planning a Documentation Suite

One insight that really changed how I think about documentation is the need for systematic planning. You need different documents for different types of users, addressing different goals with different kinds of information.

The planning process Judy outlines starts with thinking about what the documentation needs to accomplish:
- Attract users by explaining how your product helps them
- Make them successful by providing task-oriented information
- For open source, attract contributors by explaining how to join the project

Then you consider who your users are, their roles and workflows, and how they'll use your tools to accomplish specific goals.

## Document Specifications

For each document you decide to create, the course recommends writing a specification covering:

- **Project objectives**: How does this support your business/community needs?
- **Audience**: What type of user does this address?
- **Technical objectives**: What goals will this help readers accomplish?
- **Pattern of use**: How will this fit into specific workflows?
- **Content**: What subject areas will be covered?
- **Delivery medium**: How will users access this?

This level of planning was new to me, but it makes sense. Different user roles have typical workflows that suggest both content and presentation patterns.

## The Writing Process

Judy breaks down the typical writing process into three phases that really clarified what to expect:

**Phase 1: Information transfer** - Subject-matter experts provide information through written brain-dumps, interviews, or answering questions. The writer acts like a new user, asking for context and background that experts take for granted.

**Phase 2: Technical review cycles** - As drafts are produced, SMEs carefully review for accuracy and completeness. The writer marks questions and guesses, and the engineer confirms or corrects them. This is iterative.

**Phase 3: General review cycles** - After the writer and SME are satisfied, other team members review to ensure clear communication to non-experts. This includes other developers, support staff, product managers, even beta testers.

## What Writers Bring to the Process

Through these phases, the writer learns the product's purpose, usage patterns, and technical details, then:

- Works with the team to create a documentation plan and set priorities
- States information clearly, unambiguously, and consistently
- Creates and maintains glossaries and style guides for consistency
- Organizes information effectively for different user types
- Develops learning journeys for new users
- Ensures completeness and accuracy through review cycles
- Prepares documentation for publication, including accessibility and localization considerations

## Managing the Collaboration

One thing the course emphasizes is that you can't predict exactly when each writing phase will begin and end. Writing runs concurrently with development, but it's often interrupt-driven. Developers need to make time to answer questions and review drafts.

The key is creating a culture where developers understand that collaborating with technical writers saves them time overall, compared to writing documentation themselves or hand-holding frustrated users later.

For open source projects without dedicated project managers, subject-area specialists should document their contributions as best they can, then actively seek help from community writers to develop that material into publishable documentation.

## Why This Approach Works

What convinced me about this collaborative approach is that it plays to everyone's strengths. Developers focus on what they do best - building software and providing technical accuracy. Writers focus on user experience, information organization, and clear communication.

The result is documentation that's both technically accurate and actually usable, produced more efficiently than if either group tried to do everything themselves. For open source projects especially, this kind of collaboration can really multiply the value of your development efforts by making your software more accessible to new users and contributors.
